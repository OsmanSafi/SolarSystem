Submission Instructions 
Include a readme.txt file in your .zip file containing your name along with answers to the following:
1. What was your favorite topic or project in the course and why? (1pt)
2. If you could improve any aspect of this course, what would it be and why? (1pt)
3. If you could go back in time to the first week of class and give yourself advice on how to best navigate this course, what would it be? (1pt)


1. My favorite topic in this course was probably the texturing portion, when we moved on from using basic colors to adding our own images. 


2. If I could improve this course I would probably just split it into an intro and intermediate course. I think it was well taught and paced 
but there is a lot of material to dive into and I think with more time students would have a better understanding of each piece. Overall I 
think if you have the time for each topic then One semester is sufficient, but if you have a busy schedule this course added on is not just 
an average or “easy” elective. I think this course was taught perfectly in the end, because when it came to the final project I wasn’t just 
adding pieces in or copying old code, I knew at each step what I needed and why it was working. But I wasn’t working throughout the first half 
of the semester and the second half I had enough time to dive into each topic deeply but I can see a student who is juggling a lot and doesn’t 
have the time I did struggling with some topics. I enjoyed this course very much, and am glad I took it. 


3. Advice I would give myself, start each assignment early, and try to have a good idea of what each step in the assignments is trying to do as opposed to just figuring out the correct code.
